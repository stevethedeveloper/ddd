# Duck duck Deal
This project is for a site that supported a mobile app.

It was created using a previous version of CakePHP.

There is a radius search in app/models/business_offer.php that pulled all geocoded records within a specified radius.

The app used a payment gateway api, but that information has been removed.

This app is no longer being updated.  The client canceled phase 2 due to lack of funding.
